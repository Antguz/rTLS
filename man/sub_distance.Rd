\usage{
sub_distance(x, new_distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class  \code{neighborhood}.}

\item{new_distance}{A numeric vector that swhich specifies the new distance to subset.}
}
\value{
An object of class "neighborhood" with a list per point of the neighboring points.
}
\description{
Subset neighboring points based on a distance.

\examples{
data("pc_tree")

###Subset neighboring points from 0.2 to 0.1
dis <- neighborhood(pc_tree, method = "distance", radius = 0.2, parallel = FALSE)
sub_distance(dis, new_distance = 0.1)
