\title{Subsample neighboring points}
\usage{
sub_neighborhood(x, method, new_distance, new_k)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{neighborhood}.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to subsample the neighboring points. It most be one of \code{"distance"} or \code{"knn"}.}

\item{new_distance}{A \code{numeric} vector of a length 1 representing the new distance to consider. This will be used if \code{method = "distance"}. To be functional, \code{"new_distance"} most be lower than \code{"distance"} used in \code{"neighborhood"}.}

\item{new_k}{An integer of a length 1 representing the new number of neighbors to consider. This will be used if \code{method = "knn"}.  To be functional, \code{"new_k"} most be lower than \code{"k"} used in \code{"neighborhood"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "neighborhood" with a list per point of the neighboring points.
}
\description{
Subsample the neighboring points based on a distance or knn
}
\examples{
data("pc_tree")

###Subset neighboring points from a radius 0.2 to a radius of 0.1
dis <- neighborhood(pc_tree, method = "distance", radius = 0.2, parallel = FALSE)
sub_neighborhood(dis, new_distance = 0.1)
