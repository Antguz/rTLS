\usage{
knn(query, ref, k, same = FALSE, build = "kdtree", threads = 1L, checks = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A \code{data.table} containing the set of query points where each row represent a point and each column a given coordinate.}

\item{ref}{A \code{numeric} containing the set of reference points where each row represent a point and each column a given coordinate.}

\item{k}{An \code{integer} describing the number of nearest neighbors to search for.}

\item{same}{Logic. If \code{TRUE}, it delete neighbors with distance of 0, useful when the k search is based on the same query.}

\item{build}{A \code{character} describing the search structure to be used: "kdtree", "kmeans", "linear".}

\item{threads}{An \code{integer} specifying the number of threads to use for parallel processing. Experiment to see what works best for your data on your hardware. If 0, then the maximum allowable cores are used.}

\item{checks}{Number of checks during searching. Higher value gives better search precision but takes longer. See FLANN C++ manual for more details.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with three columns describing the indices of the query, ref, and k neighbors and the distances.
}
\description{
K nearest neighbors based on FLANN C++
}
\details{
This function is based on the FLAAN C++ Library (Muja and Lowe 2009) for a fast
estimation of neighbors points. It is adapted from rflann (Muja, Lowe, Yee, 2018) to
simplify the workflow with TLS data. If you use this function, please consider cite
both documents.
