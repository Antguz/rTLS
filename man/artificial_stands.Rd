\usage{
artificial_stands(files, n.trees, dimension, coordinates = NULL,
  sample = TRUE, replace = TRUE, overlap = 0, rotation = TRUE,
  degrees = NULL, plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A \code{character} vector describing the file name or path of the tree point cloud to use.}

\item{n.trees}{A positive \code{numeric} vector describing the number of point clouds to use.}

\item{dimension}{A positive \code{numeric} vector of length two describing the width and length of the future forest stand.}

\item{coordinates}{A \code{data.table} or \code{matrix} of two columns and with \code{nrows} equal to \code{n.trees} describing the basal coordinates of the point clouds in the future stant. If \code{NULL}, it uses random basal coordinates based on stand dimension. \code{NULL} as default.}

\item{sample}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, it performs a sample of the \code{files} to determine the order to build the artificial stand. If \code{FALSE}, it use the file order described in \code{files}. \code{TRUE} as default.}

\item{replace}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, it performs a sample selection with a replacement if \code{sample = TRUE} to determine the order to build the artificial stand. Useful if the \code{n.trees} is lower than \code{length(files)}. \code{TRUE} as default.}

\item{overlap}{A positive \code{numeric} vector between 0 and 100 describing the overlap percentage of a given the tree crowns in the future forest stand. If \code{NULL}, the degree of overlap is not controlled.}

\item{rotation}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, it performs a random rotation in the x and y axis of the point cloud. \code{TRUE} as default.}

\item{degrees}{A positive \code{numeric} vector describing the degree or degrees of rotation of the point cloud in the future stand. The \code{length(degree)} should be the same as \code{n.trees}. If \code{NULL}, it creates random degrees of rotation for each \code{n.trees}.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, it provides visual tracking of the distribution of each tree in the artificial stand. This can not be exported as a return object.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} which contain a \code{data.table} (Trees) with the information of the point clouds used and their current coordinates (Trees), and another \code{data.table} with that compile all the point clouds used.
}
\description{
Create an artificial forest stand of a given area using tree point clouds.
