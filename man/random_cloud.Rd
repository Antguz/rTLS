\title{Random Point Cloud}
\usage{
random_cloud(npoints, limits, minDistance)
}
\arguments{
\item{npoints}{A positive \code{numeric} vector of length 1 describing the number of points to create.}

\item{limits}{A \code{numeric} vector of length 6 representing the minimun and maximun of *XYZ* coordinates.}

\item{minDistance}{A positive \code{numeric} vector of length 1 describing the minimun distance between points.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} whit three columns representing the *XYZ* coordinates.
}
\description{
Creates a random point cloud using a given number of points, *XYZ* limints, and minimun distance between them.
}
\details{
This function create points based on the established \code{limits} and \code{minDistance} between points. It is useful more than a random number generator since the user can have control of the minimum spatial resolution of the point cloud.
}
\examples{

#Creates a random point cloud with a minimum distance of 0.5 and a range between 0 and 100.
range <- c(Xmin = 0, Xmax = 100, Ymin = 0, Ymas = 100, Zmin = 0, Zmax = 100)
random_cloud(npoints = 1000, limits =  range, minDistance = 0.5)
