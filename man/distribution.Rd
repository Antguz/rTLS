\title{Dispersion, Agregation, and Mean Distance of Neighboring Points.}
\usage{
distribution(space, radius = NULL, n_replicates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{space}{A \code{data.table} with *XYZ* coordinates of the neighboring points in the first three columns and a four column with their distance to the target point.}

\item{radius}{A \code{numeric} vector of a length 1 representing the radius of the sphere which was considered. If \code{NULL}, it use the maximun distance of \code{space} (\code{max(space[,4])}). \code{NULL} as default.}

\item{n_replicates}{An \code{interger} of a length 1 representing the number of replicates to estimate the expected distance. If \code{NULL}, it use the same number of rows of \code{space}. \code{NULL} as default.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with four metrics: i) observed mean distance, ii) expected mean distance, iii) points dispersion, iv) mean aggregation to the target point.
}
\description{
Estimate the dispersion, aggregation, and mean distance of the neighboring points to a target point..
}
\details{
The observed mean distance is estimated based on the average value of \code{space[,4]}.
The expected mean distance is computed on the average of \link{runif} values replicated n times using a range between 0 and \code{radius}.
The points dispersion is the ratio of observed mean distance and expected mean distance. The mean aggregation is estimated based on \code{mean(1 - space[4]/radius}.

\examples{
data("pc_tree")
neig <- neighborhood(pc_tree[50,], pc_tree, method = "sphere", radius = 0.2)
distribution(neig$neighborhood[, c(2:5)], radius = neig$parameter)
