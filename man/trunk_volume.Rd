\title{Tree Trunk Volume}
\usage{
trunk_volume(cloud, max.height = NULL, alpha = 0.2, plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cloud}{A \code{data.table} with three columns representing the *XYZ* coordinates of a point cloud.}

\item{max.height}{A \code{numeric} vector to contemplate points in the cloud lower than a specific height. If \code{NULL}, it performs the α-shape on the entire point cloud.}

\item{alpha}{A \code{numeric} vector of length one passed to \code{ashape3d} to describes alpha. \code{alpha = 0.20} as default since it seems to provide better estimations of the trunk volume. However, the \code{alpha} value may depends on the resolution of the point cloud.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, it uses \code{plot.ashape3d} to represent the α-shape.}

\item{...}{General arguments passed to \code{ashape3d}.}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric} vector with the estimated trunk volume.
}
\description{
Estimates the tree trunk volume of a point cloud using the \code{\link[alphashape3d]{ashape3d}} package.
}
\details{
This is an adaptation of the code develop by Lafarge & Pateiro-Lopez (2017) based on Edelsbrunner & Mucke (1994) for the quick extraction of the tree trunk volume.
Therefore, if you use this code we kindly suggest to cite these documents in your research.

\examples{
data("pc_tree")

#Estimates the trunk volume of a height lower than 1.75.
trunk_volume(pc_tree, max.height = 1.75)
