\title{Point Cloud Sphere Covering}
\usage{
sphere_covering(cloud, radius, kmax = 1, threads = 1, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cloud}{A \code{data.table} with *XYZ* coordinates in the first three columns.}

\item{radius}{A \code{numeric} vector representing the maximun radius of the spheres to consider.}

\item{kmax}{An \code{integer} vector equal or greather than 1 representing the number of k nearest neighbors to consider if a points present more than k nearst neighbors with the same distance beteween them.}

\item{threads}{An \code{integer} specifying the number of threads to use for parallel processing. Experiment to see what works best for your data on your hardware.}

\item{progress}{Show progress. \code{TRUE} as default.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} describing the cartesian position of the spheres in the cloud and their radius.
}
\description{
Create spheres between two neighboring points in a cloud.
}
\details{
The function compute a sphere between to a point and its nearst neighboring point, similar to Wang et al. 2020.
If a point present two or more nearst neighboring points with the same distance, \code{kmax} could be used to retrieve
a maximun of k-nearst points (e.g. usefull in resample point clouds where several points may share the same distance to a target point).
}
\examples{
###Estimate the dimensionality on a sample of 100 points.
#Load data
data("pc_tree")

#Run
sphere_covering(pc_tree, 0.2)
