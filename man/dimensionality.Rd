\usage{
dimensionality(
  cloud,
  cloud_b = NULL,
  method,
  radius,
  k,
  threads = 1,
  progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cloud}{A \code{data.table} with *XYZ* coordinates in the first three columns.}

\item{cloud_b}{A \code{data.table} with *XYZ* coordinates in the first three columns to estimate the neighboring points. If \code{cloud_b} is \code{NULL}, \code{cloud_b == cloud}. \code{NULL} as default.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to estimate the neighbors. It most be one of \code{"sphere"} or \code{"knn"}.}

\item{radius}{A \code{numeric} vector representing the radius of the sphere or spheres to consider. This needs be used if \code{method = "sphere"}.}

\item{k}{An \code{integer} vector representing the number of neighbors to consider. This needs be used if \code{method = "knn"}.}

\item{threads}{An \code{integer} specifying the number of threads to use for parallel processing. Experiment to see what works best for your data on your hardware.}

\item{progress}{Show progress. \code{TRUE} as default.}
}
\value{
A \code{array} describing the point of the \code{cloud} in rows, the relative eigenvalues in columns, and the \code{radius} or \code{k} per slide. If \code{method = "sphere"}, it add in the first column the number of neighbor points.
}
\description{
Estimate the dimensionality of neighboring points in a cloud.
}
\details{
The function returns the dimensionality of the neighboring points of a given point in \code{code}. The dimensionality is represented by the relative values of the
eigenvalues derived from a covariance matrix of the neighboring points.
}
\examples{
###Estimate the dimensionality on a sample of 100 points.
#Load data
data("pc_tree")

#Sample data
sample_data <- pc_tree[sample(nrow(pc_tree), 100), ]

#Using neighbors in two spheres of 0.75 and 1
dimensionality(sample_data, pc_tree, method = "sphere", radius = c(0.75, 1))

#Using two k neighbors of 50 and 100
dimensionality(cloud = sample_data, cloud_b = pc_tree, method = "knn", k = c(50, 100))
