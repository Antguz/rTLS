Description: A set of tools to process and calculate 
             metrics on point clouds derived from terrestrial LiDAR 
             (Light Detection and Ranging). Its creation is based on key 
             aspects of the TLS application in forestry and ecology. 
             Currently, the main routines are based on filtering, neighboring 
             features of points, voxelization, canopy structure, 
             and the creation of artificial stands. It is written using 
             data.table and C++ language and in most of the functions it is 
             posible to use parallel processing to speed-up the routines.
