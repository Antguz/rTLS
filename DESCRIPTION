Description: A package that compiles a set of tools to
    process and calculate metrics on point clouds derived from terrestrial
    LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Its creation is based on key
    aspects of the application of TLS to forestry.  Currently, the main
    routines are based on filtering, neighboring features of points,
    voxelization, optimal sphere or voxel size, and the creation of
    artificial stands.  In some functions, rTLS applies parrallel
    processing to speed-up the rutines and used in almost all uses
    data.table lenguaje to improve the storage and speed of the
    codes.
