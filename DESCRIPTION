Description: A package that compiles a set of tools to process and calculate metrics on point clouds derived from terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). 
             Their main routines are based on filtering, neighboring features of points, voxelization, optimal sphere or voxel size, and creation of artificial stands.
             In some functions, rTLS applies parrallel processing to speed-up the rutines and and used in almost all functions data.table lenguaje to to improve the storage and speed of the codes.
